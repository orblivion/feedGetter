An RSS downloader program written in Haskell. It doesn't have a "slick" interface, it just gets your damn files, and puts them where you want them. There are already programs for listening to your audio.

# Building

This is the usual. I'm mainly reminding myself in case I come back after years (as I have as I'm typing this).

First, install Haskell Platform. (On Debian Buster, for instance, this is the `haskell-platform` package)

Then, build this thing:

    cabal sandbox init
    cabal update
    cabal install --dependencies-only
    cabal build

# Permissions:

This software is under an MIT license (see LICENSE file). However I do this only out of the sense that it would be unethical to compel every user of the software to comply with any restrictive license. I prefer that users treat it in the spirit of the GPL, which (for the purposes of this version, anyway) I will only enforce with my appreciation.
